### main.c ###
(1) setup
We take the security parameter K(qbits, rbits) to get the system parameter, i.e. The master key of Public Key Generator (PKG).
The PKG also publishs two parameters (Know to all users):
* M: a finite message space
* C: a finite cipertext space

(2)Extract
The receiver get his private key from PKG

(3)Encrypt
The sender will generate a cipertext based on the receiver's ID

(4)Decrypt
The receiver will use his private key to get the message digest

###Versions of IDE###
(1) BasicIdent
* H1: Element built-in function (element from hash)
* H2: SHA1 function generate 160bits number
* Using Type A elliptic curve to generate pairing

(2) FullIdent
* With above
* H3: Concatenate the sigma and the message digest, then put it into built-in function element random which is chosen between [0,q]
* H4: Input a 160bits long number to generate another 160 bits number by using H2.
